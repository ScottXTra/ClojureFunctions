# ClojureFunctions
Repo for my Clojure libraries. 

A wise man named Dave showed me this language, and this is the 
repo to which my progress will be documented.

Progress over Christmas break was slow between learning German, diving deeper into x86 assembler, building of the ebike V3, and goofing off like a goomba. 

Progress will accelerate on Jan 10th -> Summer break to an unprecedented acquisition of a language of which I understood nothing a short time ago.

Acquisition, understanding, and mastery of clojure will be integral to meet and exceed the expectations and requirements of working at VP.
