repeatedly => runs a funtion (param 1) infinte times

take => takes the first n (param 1) items from a seq (param 2) 

range => generate a seq from (param 1) to (param 2) with and optinal step of (param 3)

iterate => applys function (param 1) to (param 2) repeatedly swaping in the result of (param 1) on (param 2) to be the new (param 2)

repeat => returns an infinite seq of (param 1) [Offten used with "take"]

cycle => returns a seq of (param 1) infinitly repeated [Offten used with "take"]

interleave => returns a seq of elements of seq (param 1) and seq (param 2) alternating elements untill one seq runs out

interpose => returns a seq of elements in seq (param 2) alternating elements with (param 1)
